# React Salmon Cookies

A re-visiting of the Salmon Cookies series of assignments using React to create front-end components.

Note that any code here won't actually run in the browser on its own.
It's not meant to.
This is the result of seeing what works with `jsbin.com` and more or less saving for posterity.
Will update as I figure out how to transpile and run ReactJS code.
